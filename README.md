# üéì Student Subject Enrollment System (CLI + GUI)

This project is a **Python-based student subject enrollment system** that allows students to sign up, log in, and manage their subject enrollments.  
It supports both **CLI** (Command-Line Interface) and **GUI** (Graphical User Interface) modes.  
The system enforces rules such as **maximum subject limits** and **no duplicate 3-digit subject IDs per student**.

## üìò Project Overview

The system simulates a university subject enrollment process.  
It provides modules for:
- **Student registration and login** (`student.py`, `controller.py`)
- **Subject creation and management** (`subject.py`)
- **Enrollment control and validation** (`controller.py`)
- **Data persistence** using an in-memory or file-based structure (`database.py`)
- **Menu-based navigation** via both CLI and GUI (`cli_main.py`, `gui_main.py`, `menu.py`)

Each subject is assigned a random 3-digit ID (`001`‚Äì`999`) during creation.  
A student cannot enroll in two subjects sharing the same numeric ID (e.g., `CSC101` and `MKT101`).
